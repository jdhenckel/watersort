# Thought for the day

    R&R, GN, APP, PTG, TNR-PLA

    Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again, Rejoice.
      
    Let your gentleness be evident to all.   THE LORD IS NEAR.

    Do not be anxious about anything, but 
    
    in every situation, with prayers and petitions,

    with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.

    And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding,

    will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.

    Finally, brothers and sisters, 
    whatever is True, 
    whatever is Noble, 
    whatever is Right, 
    whatever is Pure, 
    whatever is Lovely, 
    whatever is Admirable --
    if anything is Excellent or Praiseworthy -- 
    think about such things.
